She grabbed her bag, tossed in her things, and stepped out into the storm.</p>

<p>The rain was pouring, thick and cold. She made her way across the empty lot, water splashing around her feet. Her car sat under a flickering light. Old, a little rusty, and definitely not made for this kind of weather. She got in quickly, trying not to soak the seat, and turned the key.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Nothing.She tried again.Still nothing.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Leaning back, she sighed, then stepped out with her umbrella. Rain hammered down harder now. She looked around, hoping someone else might still be nearby.
That's when she saw it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Across the street, under a faulty streetlamp, someone was sitting. Still. Unmoving. Just a shadowed figure, barely visible through the rain.
Something about it felt off. A tight, cold feeling crept into her chest. She quickly got back into the car and locked the doors.She pulled out her phone, tried to call someone—anyone. No signal.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A flash of lightning lit up the lot for a moment.In the rearview mirror, she saw something.A figure. Standing behind her car.
Her heart jumped.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Panic rose. She fumbled for the door handle, trying to get out—but the doors were still locked. Her fingers scrambled to unlock it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Then—a hand.Pressed against the window, right beside her.She froze.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>And then came the scream.
Sharp and sudden,
Swallowed by the rain.
Lost in the dark.</p>`

Three dancers stepped into the lot, laughing softly between themselves—until they stopped.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Isn't that Stacy's car?” one of them asked, pointing.

It sat exactly where it had been last night, parked near the corner under the light pole. The windshield was beaded with rain. Still. Unmoved.“She must've left it here,” another said, uncertain. “Maybe someone picked her up?”And another one answered it "No way someone else would have picked her up"</p>
&nbsp;
<p>They approached, peering inside. Her dance bag sat in the passenger seat. Her jacket too.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Wait… she didn't take her stuff?” The third dancer frowned. “That's not like her.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A creeping silence pulled the group toward the building. One of them reached for the studio door, pushing it open slowly. The hallway inside greeted them with still air and the faint scent of rosin and sweat, like always—yet something felt different.

No music. No distant footsteps. No humming from the dressing room.

Only cold silence.

“…Stace?” one of them called out, voice echoing down the empty hallway.

No response.

They checked the main practice room. Nothing. The dressing area. Empty. Every corner held the same unsettling quiet.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A chill passed through the group like a shared shiver. One of them pulled out a flip phone and dialed.

Stacy's roommate answered.

“No,” came the voice on the other end. “She didn't come home last night. We thought she stayed over at the studio or something…”

The call ended.

There was a long pause before someone said what they were all thinking.

“…We should call the police.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Two hours later, the parking lot was surrounded by caution tape. The muted flash of red and blue lights reflected in puddles. A few officers moved about the scene, but there wasn't much to look at.

Detective Ben Carter stepped out of his car, coat flapping gently in the wind. Late forties, face lined with experience, eyes sharp with tired alertness. He moved with a steadiness that came from years of seeing too much.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>An officer walked up beside him. “Girl's name is Stacy. Ballet student. Car's hers. She stayed late practicing last night. Didn't make it home.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben gave a slight nod, already studying the scene. “Cameras?”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“There's one in the lot, facing this side. But the rain ruined the view. Just blurry shapes and static after about 10 PM.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben glanced at the camera mounted on the corner pole. “Convenient.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He walked over to the car. Looked inside.

Her belongings were still there, dry. Doors locked. No sign of damage.

He crouched and scanned the wet ground. The gravel had been flattened by the storm. No prints. No marks. No trace.

Nothing.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The officer beside him exhaled. “There's no sign of a struggle. No blood. No broken glass. Nothing. It's like she vanished.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben stood, slowly. His eyes swept across the lot, to the studio, then back to the car.

“…Methodical,” he said under his breath.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Sorry?” the officer asked.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben didn't answer. Not right away.

There was something in the air. Not just the cold but the kind of quiet that seemed to press in on everything. Too still.

His jaw tightened slightly.

Then, softly, almost to himself—

“It's happened before. It's happening again.”</p>`

He hadn't opened it yet.

He just sat there, elbows on the desk, hands steepled under his chin, eyes fixed on the name as if it might change if he waited long enough.

It didn't.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A flicker passed through his expression. Something like recognition—sharp, unwanted.

Seventeen years ago.

That same stillness.

That same silence after a disappearance.

He remembered the age—eighteen. The details had faded, but the feeling hadn't. His first case. The one that had never left him.

It stayed cold.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>So he started watching. Quietly. Over the years, the pattern grew—not loud, not obvious, just… consistent.

Files that didn't fit anywhere else. Cases that never connected to anything — except each other.

Ben stood slowly and walked to the shelf behind him.

The binder was heavy in his hands. Worn edges. Overstuffed with loose sheets and aging paper.
205 disappearances.

Each case recorded by him , unofficially. Alone. And now… Stacy's name sat apart from them, waiting.

She made it 206.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He flipped open her file at last, scanning briefly. Still no leads. Still no answers.

But something was there — a folded note, clipped to the back. Found in her car.

Ben unclipped it. Opened it.

He hadn't read it yet.

His eyes followed the lines in silence.</p>

<p><strong><i>
"They keep looking for monsters in the shadows. But the true cruelty walks in daylight. In silence.
No names. No families. No questions. No justice.
I only take those the world has already thrown away. I only end what others began.
This is not murder. This is mercy.
You're the first to notice. Let's see if you're worthy of the truth."</i>
</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben exhaled slowly, like the air had thickened around him.

He stared at the note a moment longer. Then, voice low:

“This isn't a confession…
It's an invitation.”</p>`

The note still rested in his hands. He read it again.

And again.

Each time, the words struck a little differently — not just what they said, but how they said it.

There was something deliberate in the way it was written. Something...familiar.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He leaned back slowly, brows furrowing. His mind began pulling from deeper shelves. Older memories.

Then it hit him.

A flicker from the very beginning. Seventeen years ago.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He stood, walked to the far end of his shelf, and pulled out a thin, brittle folder. It said "Case 1". 

The paper had yellowed slightly, edges curled. Inside, among the reports and transcripts, was an aged envelope, flattened with time. His fingers hesitated for a moment before sliding it free.

It had been found in the missing boy's mailbox, days after the report. At the time, it felt strange — poetic, surreal. Nothing concrete. Nothing useful. The forensics team had found no prints, no traceable ink, nothing but metaphors and rain.

It was dismissed. Filed away.

Until now.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben unfolded the letter.</p>
<p>
<strong><i>
The rain spoke first — soft like a secret.
It tapped on windows that were never opened.
Roads curved in ways maps forgot.
Lamps flickered, not from wind — but knowing.
Silence followed.
As it always does.</i></strong>
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He stared at the letter, breath slow.

Then, he reached for the note found in Stacy's car and set it beside the old one.

Side by side.

Same pen pressure. Same tilt in the letters. Same unnerving rhythm.

He didn't need lab confirmation.

His voice was low, just above a whisper. A little uncertain. A little shaken.</p>
<p>
“This… this isn't random.
It's a message.
A pattern.
A mission.”
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Somewhere else — not near, not far — another room sat still in darkness.

The air smelled faintly of wax and old wood. Dozens of candles burned low, casting long, flickering shadows on the walls. Pieces of paper — torn, clipped, aged — dotted the space, pinned, taped, folded, waiting.

A figure, tall and silent, stood alone in the room.

His face remained in shadow. His hands were still.

A whisper, barely audible over the flame's flicker:

<strong><i>“Some scars grow in silence…
And some…
Learn to carve back.”</i></strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>The candles sputtered softly.
And the silence returned.</p>`

                    title: "Where it all began",
                    content: `<p>The year was 1983. A younger Ben Carter stood in a rain-dampened coat, his badge newly issued, his reputation still unwritten. Fresh into the force, he was brilliant, determined, and stubborn enough to believe his way was the only way.

His first case arrived like a whisper — quiet, unassuming, but unsettling.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Missing for two days now,” said the roommate, leaning lazily against the doorway of the cramped apartment. His tone wasn't anxious , it was annoyed. “He hasn't been home. Rent's due, and now this idiot's vanished.”</p>

<p>Ben scribbled down the note without raising an eyebrow. “Name?”</p>

<p>“Henry. Henry L.”</p>

<p>“Age?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Occupation?”</p>

<p>“Bartender. Downtown.”</p>

<p>Ben glanced around the small room shared by three others. It was poorly kept, scattered with clothes, takeaway boxes, and silence. He stepped into Henry's section. A bed. A shelf. A pair of old shoes neatly kept near the edge. Sparse. Like no one really knew him.

“What was he like?” Ben asked.</p>

<p>“Quiet,” one of them muttered. “Didn't really mix. Always in his own world. Not our friend, if that's what you're asking.”

They barely cared. That's what bothered Ben.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Down by the mailbox, tucked beneath a pile of random newsletters, was a weathered envelope. No return address,just had the name <strong><i>Henry</i></strong> in a strangely elegant handwriting. Inside, a letter. Poetic. Bizarre. And, seemingly, unrelated to the disappearance.

Ben had it examined — no prints, no usable trace. It was dismissed. Just another dead end. Another mystery wrapped in a riddle with nowhere to go.That evening, Ben pinned Henry's photo on a blank board in his room — the centre of a puzzle with no edges yet. The walls were bare, but his mind wasn't. He stared at that photo, searching for something or anything in those eyes. But they were just eyes. Lost and unknowing.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The next day, Ben made his way to the bar where Henry worked. It was a dim place with a flickering neon sign and years of cigarette smoke soaked into its walls.</p>

<p>“I'm Detective Carter,” Ben introduced himself to the manager. “Need to talk about one of your employees "Henry".”</p>

<p>The manager frowned. “Yeah...heard he's missing. Good kid. Came in on time. Did his job.”</p>

<p>“Anyone had issues with him?”

A pause.</p>

<p>“Some of the other guys...they teased him sometimes. Said some pretty nasty stuff. Orphan jokes, that kind of thing. He never reacted, but I knew it got to him.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben's jaw tightened.

He stepped away from the counter and approached a small group of workers cleaning glasses and chatting casually. “Which of you worked with Henry?”</p>

<p>A few hands went up. One of them chuckled, “What, the sad kid? He was always in his corner, staring like the world owed him something.”

Ben looked at him, eyes cold.

Another one scoffed, “Maybe he finally found someone to care. Or maybe a trash can. Honestly, guy had a face only a disappearance could fix.”

That was it.

Ben's hand shot forward, slamming the guy against the bar, fingers closing tightly around his throat. The laughter died. Silence fell like a dropped glass. Ben's grip held for a second longer than needed , long enough to make a point, then he let go.

The guy gasped for breath, eyes wide, but said nothing more.</p>

<p>“You think one of them could've done something?” the manager asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>Ben nodded once. “I do.”</p>

<p>“But the night he disappeared, they were all still here. Every one of them. I was on shift. They didn't leave until well after Henry clocked out.”

Ben didn't answer. He just left.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He returned to his room, stuck more photos around Henry's co-workers, a map of the route home. He traced the line from the bar to Henry's apartment with red string, following it with his finger. One long stretch of empty road. Hardly any lights. Sparse traffic. No cameras. Just shadows, rain, and silence.

He walked that same road himself later that night. Nothing new. No tire marks. No footprints. The rain had washed everything away.

No clues. No evidence. No sound.

Days passed. Then a week.

No movement in the case.

Then came the orders.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In a stiff office lined with silence and filled with men who stopped believing in ghosts, his superior spoke flatly, “We're closing it. Could be a runaway. Maybe the kid couldn't take the mockery anymore. Happens.”

Ben stood there, silent but boiling.</p>

<p>“You don't agree, Carter?” the official asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Ben replied, without hesitation. “I don't.”</p>

<p>“There's nothing to go on.”</p>

<p>“There's something. We're just not seeing it.”</p>

<p>The official sighed. “You've done your job. Case's done. Move on.”

Ben walked out. But he didn't move on.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>That night, he stood in the rain, unmoving, the streets around him quiet and cold. Water ran down his coat. Lightning split the sky in the distance.

From across the street, hidden in the veil of shadows, something or someone watched.

A figure. Silent. Still.

And then a whisper in the dark:</p>
<p><strong><i>“Funny how some people go missing… and some stay missing.”</i></strong></p>`

A breath.

A pause.

Then another voice.

"I'm done."</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben woke up gasping, breath sharp and ragged. Sweat clung to his skin like glue. He sat upright, heart drumming against his ribs, eyes darting across the room. Still 1983. Three weeks had passed since the Henry case was shut and buried in cold ink.

The investigation board still stood in the corner, unchanged. Henry's photo still stared from the center, the lifeless eyes almost speaking now. Daily cases had come and gone since then—petty thefts, neighborhood scuffles—solved and forgotten. Nothing like Henry's. That case was... clean. Too clean. Methodical.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben rose from bed, walked to the board, and stared at the boy's photo. Eye to eye. As if asking it to explain itself.
A flood of images struck him—the roommate's indifference, the envelope, the rain.
And just like that, something broke.He lunged forward, tearing the board apart. Photos ripped, strings snapped. His hand slammed into a pin. A sharp sting, then blood. It ran across his palm, thick and bright.
Ben didn't flinch.</p>
<p>He walked to the couch, leaving a small crimson trail, searching blindly for a bandage. He found one, wrapped it tight around the wound. Then, a sudden gust of wind entered through the half-closed window.
A newspaper fluttered off the couch.
He caught it instinctively, sat down, and began to read—more to distract himself than anything else. Lines passed. Columns blurred. Then his eyes locked.
Something at the edge of the page.
A small headline, barely noticeable.
Ben shot up, newspaper falling to the floor, its pages crumpling beneath his feet. The blood from his palm smeared across the headline.
<strong>"Orphan Boy Reported Missing in Remote Town."</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>He grabbed the phone.Dialed the number to the sheriff's office in that town.<p>
<p>A few rings.Then a voice. Chewing."Yeah?"</p>
<p>"This is Detective Carter from. I'm calling about the orphan boy that went missing in your jurisdiction."</p>
<p>The sheriff sounded unimpressed. "Yeah, some guy. Orphan. Twenty-five. Been missing for four days."</p>
<p>"And the investigation?" Ben asked.</p>
<p>A laugh. Mocking."We asked around. Did some walking. Probably just ran off. Or jumped into the woods. Body'll turn up if it wants to. No one's pushing us. No family. No noise."</p>
<p>Ben gripped the receiver tighter. Rage boiled beneath his skin."Right," he muttered, slamming the phone down.</p>
<p>He grabbed Henry's case file from the mess of papers, folded the newspaper, and stormed out.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The office was quiet. His superiors sat behind a desk that had seen years of denial.</p>
<p>"These two cases Henry's and this new boy's , they're connected," Ben said while showcasing the small similarities between the cases.</p>
<p>"You want us to reopen a closed case from three weeks ago...and tie it to a missing person four states away?" the senior officer scoffed. "You realize how insane that sounds?"</p>
<p>Ben said nothing.</p>
<p>"You're chasing ghosts, Carter. Just because both were orphans? It's in your head. You're turning grief into obsession."</p>
<p>"There's a pattern," Ben replied, quietly.</p>
<p>"There's nothing. No evidence. No motive. You're seeing shadows. Let it go."</p>
<p>Ben stood frozen. Words hung in his throat, heavy and directionless. He had nothing concrete. Just a gut. A pulse.Something deeper.He walked out without a word.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Time moved forward, but Ben didn't.

The case was closed.

But not for him.

He worked as expected,but every orphan disappearance, every clean vanishing, every unresolved absence that smelt of rain and silence—he logged them.

For himself.

Unofficial. Personal.

The numbers started slow.Ten.Fifty.One hundred.One-fifty.Two hundred.

Across 17 years, they dotted the map like quiet echoes. Different states. No pattern in geography. Just in the victim. No families. No pressure. No one to make noise.

Except Ben.

And now Stacy.

She was the 206th.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Back to the present. The room was quiet again.
Ben sat, holding the two notes. Henry's. Stacy's.
Same hand. Same tone. Same ghost.
A question slipped into his mind.
"If Henry got a letter...did any of the others get it too?"</p></p>`

Stacy stood at the edge of her small rented apartment, gripping the old windowsill with knuckles pale from tension. Behind her, muffled footsteps echoed. Her landlord, a man with alcohol in his breath and rot in his eyes, made another unwanted advance.

"You haven't paid rent in two weeks," he muttered, closing in. "Maybe you can make it up in other ways."

She didn't scream. She never screamed. Not because she wasn't scared but because it never mattered. No one came. No one ever had.

She shoved him away, locked herself in her room, and broke down. Ballet was her only escape, her only peace. It wasn't just an art to her. It was survival. Every pirouette, every stretch, every aching toe spoke of a girl trying to prove she existed in a world that acted like she didn't.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Elsewhere. Somewhere deep. Somewhere hidden.A room.
The air smelled of chemical fumes and damp stone. The camera of our minds moves past candles, half-finished canvases, unfired clay sculptures, easel stains, and brushes dipped in shades of red. Not paint. Not always.

Down a narrow set of stairs behind a rusted metal door, an underground chamber waited in silence.

Stacy sat there—barely conscious, tied to a wooden chair. Her skin glistened with sweat and fear. Around her, metal cans sat sealed and some open,faintly fuming,acidic. A corner held loose cement bags, damp and ready, as if waiting for a shape to be filled.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Footsteps.
He appeared, cloaked in shadow. Calm. Precise. Intent.He moved closer, crouching to eye level.
“You always danced as if you were trying to lift yourself out of this world,” he whispered. His voice was soft. Too soft. "But you were never part of it to begin with."
Stacy whimpered, tugged at the restraints. He gently placed a hand over hers, almost with affection.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>"The world doesn't mourn orphans," he said, more to himself than to her. “You see it too, don't you? In the silence, in how no one came for you. No headlines. No one fighting for your face to be remembered."

She tried to look away, but his voice followed her.

"All your life, you've been told to be strong. To fight. To rise. But the weight isn't strength,it's abandonment wearing a pretty mask. The world does not love the ones it forgets. It only watches them collapse...quietly. And you... you've been collapsing since birth."

He stood up, pacing slowly around her. “What if I told you, Stacy, that your pain meant something? That your absence would create more meaning than your presence ever did? Not as a statistic. Not as a tragedy. But as part of something eternal, something crafted. A masterpiece not of chaos, but of symmetry. Of silence given form."

He leaned in closer again, voice nearly reverent now. “I do not kill. I release. I transform what the world threw away into something unforgettable. Your bones...they become part of a language the world cannot ignore. They carry your truth louder than your voice ever could."

Stacy's tears flowed, not just from fear now, but from confusion, from exhaustion, from a yearning to believe there had been purpose to her pain.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>"You were forgotten, Stacy," he said, with something almost like sorrow in his tone. "Let me make sure you're never forgotten again."

She stopped struggling.

Not from defeat.

But from belief.

The room darkened. The moment cut.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben Carter, sat at his desk surrounded by stacked files, open drawers, half-drunk cups of coffee gone cold.

He was calling case after case . Names blurred, numbers endless. He asked one question:

"Did anyone find a letter? A note? Anything… poetic, strange?"

Some responded with detail. Some brushed him off. Some hung up.

He knocked on doors when phones weren't enough. He sat in front of cold-faced caretakers and aged case workers. He showed his badge. Then, he showed his face,the desperation in it.

"If you found something, anything—tell me. Please."</p>
&nbsp;
<p>It took weeks.

Finally:-</p>

<p>Case 1  : Yes, Henry got the letter, but dismissed.</p>
<p>Case 20 : Another envelope with a note. Same tone.</p>
<p>Case 82 : Strange poem, they'd said.</p>
<p>Case 91 : Found in a drawer. An envelope. A poetic note in it. Never reported.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Stacy's note was not a letter she got, she hadn't recieved any letter in recent times. It was placed by the killer, just for Ben to see it.

Ben wrote the numbers on his board in red:<strong> 1, 20, 82, 91. </strong>

He sat with them. Tried everything.

Dates. Math. Initials. Coordinates. Nothing.

He stopped sleeping. His walls bore the weight of threads and pins, old photos curled at the corners. He snapped a pencil in frustration. Then another.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Then, one night his eyes widened.

<strong>1. 20. 1982.</strong>

Not just numbers. A date.

January 20th, 1982.

Something happened that day.

Ben stared at the numbers, heart racing.

The story wasn't just repeating. It started long before he ever noticed.

And now , It was pointing back to where it began.</p>`

It bleeds through.Long before Ben Carter wore the badge and chased shadows through the rain, he was just another forgotten face in the corners of an old orphanage. The place stood in a quiet, crooked part of town—half its walls peeling, windows cracked but still clinging on. And yet, within those fractured walls, something rare breathed: art.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The man the children called Master wasn't an ordinary caretaker. He never raised his voice. He never scolded. He simply taught—about light, about form, about how colour could say what words couldn't. He sculpted silence into meaning and handed brushes to those who had none.

Ben had arrived young, alone, and furious at the world. But under Master's steady guidance, that rage became something else. He sketched obsessively. He mixed paints with instinct. He wasn't just good, he was brilliant.

And he knew it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
The orphanage held an annual tradition. Every January 20th, they would submit artworks to the regional exhibition,a tradition spanning decades. Artists from neighbouring towns, students, professionals they all came to display their work. For two years in a row, Ben's art had stood out. People remembered his name. He was the star child from the forgotten place.

The admiration became expectation. Then obsession.

But the light he cast was long enough to cast a shadow.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Tom, two years younger, was quieter. Observant. Kind. He watched Ben with admiration, sketching in silence, copying his brush strokes, not with malice, but love. He wanted to be like Ben.

That year, Ben turned 19. It was meant to be just another year of victory, of applause.

But this year would be different.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>For the first time, Tom would be participating in the exhibition.

The walls of the orphanage buzzed with quiet energy. Children bent over canvases. Ben, already established as the best among them, carried the weight of expectation. He worked alone, deep into the night. Focused. Controlled. Determined to remain untouchable.

And Tom, in his small corner, painted too. Not to win. Not to dethrone. But to be seen.</p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>The Exhibition</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>The room was alive with chatter. Paintings lined the walls. Sculptures rested under dim spotlights. And Ben stood beside his canvas with a familiar certainty.

His piece was, as always, meticulous. Shadows layered just right. Colour balanced like a symphony. The judges nodded, pleased. He heard the praise.

Then they turned to Tom's painting.

And something shifted.

The crowd grew silent.They leaned closer.

The piece wasn't technically perfect. The lines were raw, the colour messy in places. But it moved. There was something in it , a kind of trembling honesty that Ben's own lacked.

A man near the back whispered, "That kid's got something special."</p>

<p>Ben heard it. He felt it.The certainty cracked.

A whisper of jealousy took root.

Ben didn't lash out or scream. But something in his expression stiffened,tightened.

BEN (quiet, controlled, but on edge)"Interesting. This seems... familiar."

Whispers. Raised eyebrows. People looked between the two pieces.

Ben stepped aside and pulled out his sketchbook. He flipped through the pages with quiet urgency—an edge of desperation behind his calm face—until he found the one he needed.

He held it up.Same posture. Same composition. The resemblance was striking.

BEN (barely concealing his tension)"I'm not saying he stole it. But if you look closely... well, you tell me."</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Gasps. Conversations turned. People started drawing conclusions. Not because of the proof alone—but because it was Ben.

Tom looked stunned. His lips trembled, but no words came. He shook his head, trying to speak, but no sound left his mouth.

A child nearby whispered, “He copied?”

The weight of the crowd shifted. Tom's face broke. And without another word—he turned and ran.

Out of the hall. Into the streets.

Gone.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>That Night.Rain fell softly. The orphanage slept. But in the empty art hall, Ben sat alone. His painting hung behind him—untouched, pristine.

Master stepped in, his footsteps slow.<p>
&nbsp;
<p>MASTER (quietly) : He's gone.Into the woods.</p>

<p>BEN (flat) : He made that choice.</p>

<p>MASTER : And you made yours.</p>

<p>BEN : I showed them the truth. That sketchbook doesn't lie.</p>

<p>MASTER : No... it doesn't. But maybe you did. Not with your words, Ben. With your heart.</p>

<p>BEN (tense, unsure) : He took what was mine. My brushstrokes. My idea. It was mine first.</p>

<p>MASTER (calmly) : Or maybe... he was learning. Admiring. Children do that.What you did wasn't justice. It was fear. It was pride... disguised as proof.</p>

<p>BEN (stepping forward) : You think I wanted this? I needed them to see me. I couldn't lose that.</p>

<p>MASTER : And now they did. They saw your work, Ben. But they didn't feel it.</p>

<p>BEN : What does that mean?</p>

<p>MASTER (soft, steady) : There's no soul in your work anymore. There's only you. Your need to win. To be remembered.And now, there's blood on your brush—even if no one sees it.</p>
<p>(Silence...)</p>
<p>Ben turned and looked at his painting—the colours perfect, the lines flawless. And suddenly... it all felt empty.</p>
<p>BEN (quietly) : I'm done. With all of this.</p>
<p>MASTER (nods once) : You always were.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Master walked away, leaving the boy alone under yellow light, his shadow long and still across the floor.

Ben never picked up a brush again.

He locked his sketchbooks away, buried the colour, buried the soul.

He stepped into a world where everything had an answer. Where truth lived in facts. And where emotion—the very thing that once made his art beautiful—was no longer welcome.

He left art. But he couldn't abandon it.

Every year, without fail, Ben would still attend the January 20th exhibition. Not to admire, but to mock. To see what mediocrity was now being praised as art. To satisfy the echo in his mind that told him his way—his vision—was the only truth.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>And then, as always, in 1982 too, he went to the exhibition. But this time...something happened.Something that could not be undone.</p>`

                    title: "The Soul Search",
                    content: `<p>The cold wind that brushed Ben's coat that January evening in 1982 felt no different from the years before. Same date. Same gallery. Same purpose. He never came to appreciate — he came to prove to himself that nothing had changed. That mediocrity still wore a crown and the fire in him had not died.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The exhibition hall bustled with chatter. Paintings and sculptures lined the long corridors, eager artists stood nearby, hoping for a nod or glance. Ben walked through the hall with calculated disinterest. He scoffed at some pieces. Ignored most. It wasn't art to him — just desperate noise. And like always, the more he saw, the more assured he felt. His way was still the only way.

Then he stopped.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A sculpture stood ahead — tall, misproportionately, and hauntingly lifelike. It was a full-scale human form, stripped of skin, revealing musculature and sinew in chilling detail. Every tendon, every fiber of anatomy was sculpted with obsessive precision.

Ben narrowed his eyes.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>BEN (muttering) : What is even is this? </p><p>The artist, Alex, stood nearby. Nervous. Watching.</p>
<p>BEN (louder) : This isn't art. This is...disgusting. Who made this?</p>
<p>ALEX (quietly) : I did.</p>
<p>Ben turned, facing him.</p>
<p>BEN : And what exactly were you trying to say with it?</p>
<p>ALEX : It's the human form. The truth beneath the surface. Not polished. Not fake. Just... real.</p>
<p>BEN : Real doesn't mean good. Art isn't just about showing what's there. It's about what it means. What it feels like. This has no heart. No soul. Just muscle and bones.</p>
<p>ALEX : But that's the point. Not everything has to be pretty. Art should make people feel something — even discomfort.</p>
<p>BEN : Discomfort isn't meaning. Shocking people isn't the same as moving them. This looks like something from a lab, not a gallery.</p>
<p>People nearby started listening. A few stared at the sculpture with new eyes — disturbed, unsure.</p>
<p>ALEX (slowly) : I made it with purpose. With care. It's not meant to be easy.</p>
<p>BEN : But if no one understands it , if it just confuses or disgusts...maybe the problem isn't the viewer. Maybe it's you.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He walked on.

Behind him, Alex stood silent, motionless beside his creation, the crowd dispersing with muttered comments and turned heads. His shoulders sagged.

And Ben never looked back.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Present Day.The image flashed in Ben's mind — that sculpture, the veins, the stillness, the detail. It wasn't art. It was method.
Ben couldn't sleep that night.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He drove to the regional archives the next morning, only to be told the exhibition records had been boxed years ago and were now held in a dusty municipal storage facility.

Three phone calls, two signatures, and a three-hour wait later — he was in. Surrounded by rows of rusted shelves, cardboard boxes stacked like forgotten tombstones.

He dug.

For hours.

Hands blackened by old tape and decaying paper, eyes stinging from dust.

Box after box.

Until finally — he found the one marked <strong>"ART EXHIBITION - JANUARY 1982."</strong>

His fingers trembled as he opened it. A ledger inside. Names of participants. Booth numbers. Art titles.

And then he saw it.</p>
<p><strong>
Alex Warren.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 41.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medium: Sculpture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title: "Echoes Pressed Into Skin."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Studio Address: South Ridge, Outer Town District.</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben circled the name with a thick red pen.But he wasn't done.He visited the art council office to cross-check the address. Then the town registrar's office , they had no recent records on Alex. No license renewals. No tax filings. Nothing for nearly two decades.
He called former council members, old artists from the exhibition . Some remembered the sculpture, most didn't. The few who did? All said the same thing:</p>
<p>"Yeah, that guy disappeared after that year."
"He got humiliated. Packed up. Never saw him again."</p>
<p>No trail. No family. No friends. Just a name. A memory. A silence.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben drove to the edge of town. Through roads with more dust than signs. Past collapsed fences and wind-bent trees.

And there, tucked behind a wall of dying vines,a studio.

Windows blacked out. Door rusted. Silent.

Ben stepped out of the car.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He stood there in front of it — sweat on his collar, wind in his coat, heart pounding not from fear, but from knowing he finally found something.But he also knew ,Whatever lay behind that door wasn't just the end of a mystery.
It was the beginning of a reckoning.</p>`

                    title: "The Reflection",
                    content: `<p>The sky was grey when Ben Carter stood before the old studio.
The building leaned as if time had grown tired of holding it up. Weeds sprouted through the concrete like veins under aged skin. Rust streaked the lock that clung to the wooden door-corroded, but still intact.
Ben glanced around. The outskirts of town were quiet. No curious eyes. No one to ask questions.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He reached into his coat pocket, pulling out a slim tension wrench and a rusted flathead. Years in law enforcement had taught him how to pick locks-but now, that knowledge felt like it belonged to a different man.
Click.
The lock gave way with a reluctant sigh. The door creaked open.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A wall of dust greeted him.
He stepped inside.
The air was stale-tinted with mildew and something chemical, sharp and lingering. Light struggled in through the grimy windows, catching motes that floated like ash. The studio was silent, but it screamed with obsession.
Everywhere he looked: sculptures.
Not of beauty, not of imagination—but of human anatomy.
Figures with flesh peeled away. Muscle tissue locked mid-motion. Ligaments stretched in poses too specific to be art, yet too intimate to be medical. The poses weren't generic-they were emotional. Pained. Worshipful. One sculpture reached toward the ceiling, ribs exposed like open hands.</p>
<p>Ben's eyes moved to the floor.
Papers scattered everywhere. Paintings—many torn, all dusted. Some lined the corners, half-finished, others pinned to boards, all with one recurring subject: the human form, stripped bare.
He moved carefully through the chaos.
Then he saw it.
The sculpture from 1982.
Its posture unchanged.
The same realism. The same grotesque perfection.
He remembered it vividly—his mocking words, the crowd's reaction, the shame etched into the artist's face. Ben exhaled slowly.
Time hadn't aged the sculpture. Only the man who once dismissed it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He knelt, picked up a fallen sketchbook. Blew the dust off.
Each page was a lesson in obsession: skeletal diagrams. Femurs. Patella. Scapula. Every bone drawn meticulously. Each labeled in ink so faded, it looked like it bled through the page.
He found another sketchbook. Then another.
Every page, every line—anatomy. No names. No faces. Just bone, muscle, flesh.
And then he spotted it.
A folded piece of paper. Yellowed. Fragile. Like something forgotten in time.
Ben opened it.
It looked like a blueprint—a room layout. Hand-drawn. Scribbled annotations. Everything matched what he saw around him...Except one wall.
He turned toward it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A large, dust-covered mirror stood there. Cracked at the edges, warped by years. His own reflection stared back , faint, ghostly.
To the side of the mirror: a rusted fuse box.
Ben opened it. Old switches. Wires. A broken label.
He flipped one. Nothing. He flipped another.
Clunk.
A sound echoed,like a lock releasing.
Ben stared at the mirror. It had shifted,inward.
He stepped closer. Pressed his hand against the edge.
With effort, he pushed.
The mirror moved.
Behind it , a narrow stairwell.
Dark. Descending.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben hesitated only a second, then stepped inside.
With every step down, the air grew heavier.
A pungent, acrid smell curled through his nostrils. It stung the back of his throat. He wrapped a cloth over his mouth. The faint hum of electricity came from below. A dim, flickering red glow began to pulse at the end of the staircase.
His boot hit the floor.
He had reached the lair.
The room opened like a wound.
Concrete walls. Stained. Cracked. Wires snaking across the ceiling. Rusted cans stacked along the walls, some sealed, others leaking a translucent residue. A table full of tools . Not surgical, but sculptural. Sharp. Repurposed.
At the far end of the room, a figure stood.
Back turned. Still. Waiting.
Ben drew his weapon.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>BEN (calm, measured) : I don't want this to end with a bullet. Turn around.</p>
<p>The figure didn't move.
Then, softly he spoke.
</p>
<p>ALEX (quiet) : I knew you'd come. I needed you to.</p>
<p>BEN : Why? You knew I'd find you eventually.</p>
<p>ALEX (still turned) : You were the first to notice. Even back then. You didn't understand it,but you saw it. That was enough.</p>
<p>BEN : What I saw was a man desperate for shock. Not substance. You built horror and called it art.</p>
<p>ALEX (finally turning to face him) : And you built judgment and called it truth. You couldn't hear what the piece was saying, Ben. You were too loud with your pride.</p>
<p>Ben stepped forward, eyes locked.</p>
<p>BEN : I spoke up because I believed in what art should be something that speaks with soul. Not strips it away. That sculpture of yours? It was anatomy...with no heart.</p>
<p>ALEX (smirks, faintly) : No. It was the heart. You just couldn't stomach how it looked when it wasn't dressed up to be adored.</p>
<p>BEN (sharper now) : You used your talent to destroy. Not to elevate. You think all this(gestures at the lair)is purpose?</p>
<p>ALEX (voice low, steady) : No. This is truth. Stripped. Still. Silent.</p>
<p>Pause. He steps toward the wall.</p>
<p>ALEX : I'll tell you what they never asked me. What no one stayed long enough to hear.</p>
<p>Ben watches him quietly.</p>
<p>ALEX : Stories don't start where you think they do, Ben...mine began long before you spoke my name.</p>`

                11 : {title: "206 : A Confession",
                    content: `<p>The basement stood silent, save for the faint buzz of old wires. Alex's eyes drifted to the floor as though watching shadows of memories coil beneath his feet.
His voice, when it came, was quiet...yet every word felt heavy, carved from years of bitterness.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>ALEX : I was never meant for the stage… nor the spotlight. I drew in silence. Always have.</p>
<p>He took a slow step forward, fingers grazing the dusty table nearby — the one littered with broken brushes and worn-down sculpting tools.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>ALEX: For years, my life was lines and labels. Medical diagrams. Precise...accurate...emotionless. Drawing the same bones, the same muscles, again...and again... and again. A craftsman, not an artist. A ghost behind someone else's knowledge.
But it wasn't enough. It...it couldn't be. I wanted more than accuracy. I wanted freedom - creation. To show what I see...what I feel.
And so I turned to the canvas. To clay. To steel and stone. I built this place...far from the city...far from the noise. Out here...no textbooks, no publishers...just creation.
But the world doesn't care for new voices. I knocked on doors, sent letters, called galleries. All I wanted was to show them something...something that was mine.
They never answered. Rejection after rejection. Months turned to years...my walls filled with pieces no one wanted to see. I told myself — keep going, just one yes...one chance.
And then it came. The exhibition. The one that would change everything. A hall where voices are heard...where artists become known.
I remember the day I carried my sculpture through those doors. I remember how proud I was...how alive I felt...how certain I was that finally , finally — someone would understand.”
That's where I saw you, Ben.That day...your words cut deeper than any rejection letter. Deeper than silence.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben's jaw tightened, but he said nothing—letting the confession spill like a slow, suffocating tide.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>ALEX:I'd told myself...this piece, this exhibition-it would be my redemption. I stood beside it, thinking...hoping...this would be the moment they see me.
But when you spoke...when you stood there, mocking...others followed. They always do. A single voice becomes a choir, and before I knew it...my creation wasn't art anymore. It was a joke...A target...another reason to disappear.”
That day, I didn't hear critique. I heard mockery. Humiliation.</p>
<p>(Gasps)</p>
<p>ALEX:I left that day...and no one ever came looking.Something shifted after that. Years of rejection...isolation...they had already chipped away at me. But that day...it cracked me wide open.
All my life..."they said, create what's needed. Draw what's useful. What's correct. Then they said, create what's beautiful,what sells,what pleases the eye.
No one ever said - create what's true".</p>
<p>His footsteps echoed softly as he moved across the concrete floor, slow, deliberate.</p>
<p>ALEX:That day, walking out of that hall, I decided...if the world wouldn't look at my art...then I would carve something they couldn't ignore. Something...no one could dismiss as imitation, or mediocrity.
"Originality...became my obsession". A year...I spent a year after that day, Ben. After you...after they laughed. I told myself it was over. But it never really stopped, not in here. 
I didn't jump to this. No, I...studied. Watched. Gathered what I needed. I wanted to build something...a masterpiece that couldn't be laughed at. Something...undeniable.
And when the time came, I didn't look for fame or revenge. I looked for truth. I found it...in the back alley of a bar.
A bartender, eighteen. No family. No name anyone would remember. Just...another orphan of this world, shuffled in and out of foster homes, discarded like yesterday's trash.</p>
<p>(pauses, leans in slightly)</p>
<p>ALEX:You know what broke me, Ben? Not just the world ignoring me. It was realizing...they ignore so many. People like him...people like I was. Forgotten before they ever had a chance.
So I...freed him.It wasn't rage. It wasn't cruelty. It was...release. The city didn't even blink. No headline, no search party...nothing.And I understood.
Society throws some of us away long before we're dead. I just...finish what the world already started.That was the first. The beginning of something more honest than any gallery would've let me show.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>(a faint smile forming, like he's remembering a song)</p>
<p>ALEX:After that first night...I knew. I knew what I was meant to create. Not something on a canvas, not in clay — something...alive in its silence. Something the world couldn't ignore.
One became five. Then ten. Then thirty. Each… different. Each chosen. Each piece added a new layer, a new truth to the work.
People think artists use brushes, Ben. But I used absence. The absence of names. Of pasts. Of screams no one hears.
They were orphans, forgotten by the world long before I touched them. I didn't take...I finished what had already been abandoned.
And as the numbers grew, so did the vision.Thirty became fifty. Then eighty. A hundred. The lines blurred. It wasn't about the number anymore,it was about the form.
But I knew...I always knew...that it would end at two hundred and six.
The final stroke. The last breath.
The last piece of the masterpiece.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben's breath slowed...heavy...His eyes tracked Alex's steps — toward the far end of the basement...where the flickering light pulsed stronger, casting uneven shadows on the stained concrete walls.
Alex didn't speak anymore. He didn't need to.Ben followed. Reluctantly. Each step heavier than the last.Then...The room opened.
And Ben's world cracked.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>There it stood. Suspended. Twisted. Blinding in its horror...but precise in its structure.
A skeleton — but not one person. Not one body. Bones woven together with wire, steel, and a sculptor's meticulous hand. Femurs intertwined with ribs that didn't belong together. A spine that curved unnaturally, branching into multiple directions...arms positioned like broken branches of a dying tree...skulls — not just one — fragmented pieces fitted like a grotesque mosaic.
Ben felt his throat tighten. His grip around his gun slackened.
This wasn't just murder.
This wasn't just killing.
This was architecture...of madness.
Two hundred and six bones from countless souls stitched into a single towering structure a monument of delusion.
The red light flickered, casting grotesque shadows across its surface, making it move — like it breathed.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben swallowed.Every breath felt heavy.Alex's grin was small...proud...corrupted.
Ben's stare didn't leave the towering skeleton… but his words cut through the thick air.</p>
<p>BEN(Pained and broken) : And the rest of them? The people you killed… where are they?</p>
<p>Alex's smile didn't waver. Instead, he stepped aside...motioning with his hand towards the far corner of the room, where dull, rectangular blocks sat stacked — concrete slabs, grey and unmarked, forming a crude, silent wall.</p>
<p>ALEX : The year after the exhibition...when everyone forgot me...I didn't forget them.</p>
<p>BEN : What did you do?</p>
<p>ALEX : I gathered what I needed. Sulphuric acid...gallons of it , Baking soda...bags upon bags. Every little detail. After every release, after every death ,their remains were melted away. Neutralised. Reduced to nothing but slush.
Then… sealed. Each slab… a grave, a memory, a chapter… part of the monument.</p>
<p>BEN : You buried them...in stone.</p>
<p>ALEX : No,I preserved them in creation. While the world ignored their cries,I built something eternal.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben took a step back, his breath shallow, mind spiraling at the scale of horror displayed before him — bone and stone… blood and silence.
Hestood frozen in front of the towering skeleton, the concrete monument looming in the shadows behind it. The finality of it all pressed down on him like a vice. The weight of seventeen years. The weight of every life stolen, encased in silence and stone.
His grip tightened around the gun.Alex didn't move.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>ALEX:You see it now, don't you? The masterpiece...complete. They can't ignore me anymore. They won't.</p>
<p>Ben's hand trembled. His vision blurred—not from fear, but from the flood of guilt crawling up his spine, squeezing his heart.</p>
<p>BEN(crackling):I...i am the reason for this.</p>
<p>Alex smiled, soft... almost content.</p>
<p>ALEX:No, Ben.You just lit the match.</p>
<p>BEN:You won't take another life.</p>
<p>Alex didn't fight. He simply stood tall, chin raised, eyes calm, and for the first time...fulfilled.</p>
<p>ALEX:It's enough. I've finished what I began.</p>
<p>A single shot echoed.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Alex collapsed... no resistance,no fear,just a faint smile lingering on his face as life left his body.
Ben stood there, the gun lowering slowly, his chest hollow.
He stumbled out of the studio, out into the storm. Rain pelted his skin, thunder rolled in the distance.
His tears mixed with the rain.He walked away, drenched, broken...carrying with him a guilt heavier than any punishment.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p><i><strong>In the end...Alex had won. His masterpiece lived on — recognition carved in concrete and bone.And Ben… was left with the truth, which will become heavier than ever as time flows.
It's never just the words we speak. It's the lens we carry — the filter through which we judge, dismiss, or define someone else's worth.
Ben thought he saw clearly. But what he saw was a reflection of his own pride… not Alex's pain.
One careless comment, born not of cruelty...but of ego. One moment where he couldn't step outside himself,to see the world through another man's eyes.
And that moment...became a spark. A spark that lit a fire beneath years of rejection and silence.We like to believe monsters are born. But sometimes, they're made — carved slowly, by indifference, by blindness, by the refusal to understand.
Alex found purpose in destruction. Ben found guilt in truth.And somewhere in between...the cost of not listening...echoed louder than any scream.</strong></i></p>`
