                    &nbsp;

<p>The rain outside had picked up, beating against the windows in heavy waves. Thunder rolled in the distance, but Stacy didn't notice. Time didn't matter. She was completely lost in her routine.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The clock on the wall blinked red. Past 10 PM.
A sudden crack of thunder snapped her out of her focus. Breathing heavily, she stopped, looked around, and finally checked the time. It was late. Too late.
She grabbed her bag, tossed in her things, and stepped out into the storm.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The rain was pouring, thick and cold. She made her way across the empty lot, water splashing around her feet. Her car sat under a flickering light. Old, a little rusty, and definitely not made for this kind of weather. She got in quickly, trying not to soak the seat, and turned the key.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Nothing.She tried again.Still nothing.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Leaning back, she sighed, then stepped out with her umbrella. Rain hammered down harder now. She looked around, hoping someone else might still be nearby.
That's when she saw it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Across the street, under a faulty streetlamp, someone was sitting. Still. Unmoving. Just a shadowed figure, barely visible through the rain.
Something about it felt off. A tight, cold feeling crept into her chest. She quickly got back into the car and locked the doors.She pulled out her phone, tried to call someone—anyone. No signal.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A flash of lightning lit up the lot for a moment.In the rearview mirror, she saw something.A figure. Standing behind her car.
Her heart jumped.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Panic rose. She fumbled for the door handle, trying to get out—but the doors were still locked. Her fingers scrambled to unlock it.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Then—a hand.Pressed against the window, right beside her.She froze.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>And then came the scream.
Sharp and sudden,
Swallowed by the rain.
Lost in the dark.</p>`

                2: {
                    title: "Case no. 206",
                    content: `<p>Morning rolled in with heavy gray clouds still hanging low, as if the storm hadn't quite left. The ballet studio sat still under the weight of damp silence, its windows fogged, its walls holding onto the chill of the night before.

Three dancers stepped into the lot, laughing softly between themselves—until they stopped.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Isn't that Stacy's car?” one of them asked, pointing.

It sat exactly where it had been last night, parked near the corner under the light pole. The windshield was beaded with rain. Still. Unmoved.“She must've left it here,” another said, uncertain. “Maybe someone picked her up?”And another one answered it "No way someone else would have picked her up"</p>
&nbsp;
<p>They approached, peering inside. Her dance bag sat in the passenger seat. Her jacket too.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Wait… she didn't take her stuff?” The third dancer frowned. “That's not like her.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A creeping silence pulled the group toward the building. One of them reached for the studio door, pushing it open slowly. The hallway inside greeted them with still air and the faint scent of rosin and sweat, like always—yet something felt different.

No music. No distant footsteps. No humming from the dressing room.

Only cold silence.

“…Stace?” one of them called out, voice echoing down the empty hallway.

No response.

They checked the main practice room. Nothing. The dressing area. Empty. Every corner held the same unsettling quiet.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A chill passed through the group like a shared shiver. One of them pulled out a flip phone and dialed.

Stacy's roommate answered.

“No,” came the voice on the other end. “She didn't come home last night. We thought she stayed over at the studio or something…”

The call ended.

There was a long pause before someone said what they were all thinking.

“…We should call the police.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Two hours later, the parking lot was surrounded by caution tape. The muted flash of red and blue lights reflected in puddles. A few officers moved about the scene, but there wasn't much to look at.

Detective Ben Carter stepped out of his car, coat flapping gently in the wind. Late forties, face lined with experience, eyes sharp with tired alertness. He moved with a steadiness that came from years of seeing too much.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>An officer walked up beside him. “Girl's name is Stacy. Ballet student. Car's hers. She stayed late practicing last night. Didn't make it home.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben gave a slight nod, already studying the scene. “Cameras?”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“There's one in the lot, facing this side. But the rain ruined the view. Just blurry shapes and static after about 10 PM.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben glanced at the camera mounted on the corner pole. “Convenient.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He walked over to the car. Looked inside.

Her belongings were still there, dry. Doors locked. No sign of damage.

He crouched and scanned the wet ground. The gravel had been flattened by the storm. No prints. No marks. No trace.

Nothing.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The officer beside him exhaled. “There's no sign of a struggle. No blood. No broken glass. Nothing. It's like she vanished.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben stood, slowly. His eyes swept across the lot, to the studio, then back to the car.

“…Methodical,” he said under his breath.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Sorry?” the officer asked.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben didn't answer. Not right away.

There was something in the air. Not just the cold but the kind of quiet that seemed to press in on everything. Too still.

His jaw tightened slightly.

Then, softly, almost to himself—

“It's happened before. It's happening again.”</p>`

                3: {
                    title: "The echoes of past",
                    content: `<p>Rain tapped against the window, soft but steady, the kind that soaked into the bones of the city without anyone noticing. Inside the dimly lit room, a single folder lay untouched on Ben Carter's desk. It is said "Stacy M".

He hadn't opened it yet.

He just sat there, elbows on the desk, hands steepled under his chin, eyes fixed on the name as if it might change if he waited long enough.

It didn't.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>A flicker passed through his expression. Something like recognition—sharp, unwanted.

Seventeen years ago.

That same stillness.

That same silence after a disappearance.

He remembered the age—eighteen. The details had faded, but the feeling hadn't. His first case. The one that had never left him.

It stayed cold.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>So he started watching. Quietly. Over the years, the pattern grew—not loud, not obvious, just… consistent.

Files that didn't fit anywhere else. Cases that never connected to anything — except each other.

Ben stood slowly and walked to the shelf behind him.

The binder was heavy in his hands. Worn edges. Overstuffed with loose sheets and aging paper.
205 disappearances.

Each case recorded by him , unofficially. Alone. And now… Stacy's name sat apart from them, waiting.

She made it 206.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He flipped open her file at last, scanning briefly. Still no leads. Still no answers.

But something was there — a folded note, clipped to the back. Found in her car.

Ben unclipped it. Opened it.

He hadn't read it yet.

His eyes followed the lines in silence.</p>

<p><strong><i>
"They keep looking for monsters in the shadows. But the true cruelty walks in daylight. In silence.
No names. No families. No questions. No justice.
I only take those the world has already thrown away. I only end what others began.
This is not murder. This is mercy.
You're the first to notice. Let's see if you're worthy of the truth."</i>
</strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben exhaled slowly, like the air had thickened around him.

He stared at the note a moment longer. Then, voice low:

“This isn't a confession…
It's an invitation.”</p>`

                    content: `<p>Ben hadn't moved from his desk.

The note still rested in his hands. He read it again.

And again.

Each time, the words struck a little differently — not just what they said, but how they said it.

There was something deliberate in the way it was written. Something...familiar.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He leaned back slowly, brows furrowing. His mind began pulling from deeper shelves. Older memories.

Then it hit him.

A flicker from the very beginning. Seventeen years ago.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He stood, walked to the far end of his shelf, and pulled out a thin, brittle folder. It said "Case 1". 

The paper had yellowed slightly, edges curled. Inside, among the reports and transcripts, was an aged envelope, flattened with time. His fingers hesitated for a moment before sliding it free.

It had been found in the missing boy's mailbox, days after the report. At the time, it felt strange — poetic, surreal. Nothing concrete. Nothing useful. The forensics team had found no prints, no traceable ink, nothing but metaphors and rain.

It was dismissed. Filed away.

Until now.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben unfolded the letter.</p>
<p>
<strong><i>
The rain spoke first — soft like a secret.
It tapped on windows that were never opened.
Roads curved in ways maps forgot.
Lamps flickered, not from wind — but knowing.
Silence followed.
As it always does.</i></strong>
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He stared at the letter, breath slow.

Then, he reached for the note found in Stacy's car and set it beside the old one.

Side by side.

Same pen pressure. Same tilt in the letters. Same unnerving rhythm.

He didn't need lab confirmation.

His voice was low, just above a whisper. A little uncertain. A little shaken.</p>
<p>
“This… this isn't random.
It's a message.
A pattern.
A mission.”
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Somewhere else — not near, not far — another room sat still in darkness.

The air smelled faintly of wax and old wood. Dozens of candles burned low, casting long, flickering shadows on the walls. Pieces of paper — torn, clipped, aged — dotted the space, pinned, taped, folded, waiting.

A figure, tall and silent, stood alone in the room.

Their face remained in shadow. Their hands were still.

A whisper, barely audible over the flame's flicker:

<strong><i>“Some scars grow in silence…
And some…
Learn to carve back.”</i></strong></p>
&nbsp;
<p>The candles sputtered softly.
And the silence returned.</p>`

                5: {
                    title: "Where it all began",
                    content: `<p>The year was 1983. A younger Ben Carter stood in a rain-dampened coat, his badge newly issued, his reputation still unwritten. Fresh into the force, he was brilliant, determined, and stubborn enough to believe his way was the only way.

His first case arrived like a whisper — quiet, unassuming, but unsettling.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>“Missing for two days now,” said the roommate, leaning lazily against the doorway of the cramped apartment. His tone wasn't anxious , it was annoyed. “He hasn't been home. Rent's due, and now this idiot's vanished.”</p>

<p>Ben scribbled down the note without raising an eyebrow. “Name?”</p>

<p>“Henry. Henry L.”</p>

<p>“Age?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Occupation?”</p>

<p>“Bartender. Downtown.”</p>

<p>Ben glanced around the small room shared by three others. It was poorly kept, scattered with clothes, takeaway boxes, and silence. He stepped into Henry's section. A bed. A shelf. A pair of old shoes neatly kept near the edge. Sparse. Like no one really knew him.

“What was he like?” Ben asked.</p>

<p>“Quiet,” one of them muttered. “Didn't really mix. Always in his own world. Not our friend, if that's what you're asking.”

They barely cared. That's what bothered Ben.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Down by the mailbox, tucked beneath a pile of random newsletters, was a weathered envelope. No return address,just had the name <strong><i>Henry</i></strong> in a strangely elegant handwriting. Inside, a letter. Poetic. Bizarre. And, seemingly, unrelated to the disappearance.

Ben had it examined — no prints, no usable trace. It was dismissed. Just another dead end. Another mystery wrapped in a riddle with nowhere to go.That evening, Ben pinned Henry's photo on a blank board in his room — the centre of a puzzle with no edges yet. The walls were bare, but his mind wasn't. He stared at that photo, searching for something or anything in those eyes. But they were just eyes. Lost and unknowing.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The next day, Ben made his way to the bar where Henry worked. It was a dim place with a flickering neon sign and years of cigarette smoke soaked into its walls.</p>

<p>“I'm Detective Carter,” Ben introduced himself to the manager. “Need to talk about one of your employees "Henry".”</p>

<p>The manager frowned. “Yeah...heard he's missing. Good kid. Came in on time. Did his job.”</p>

<p>“Anyone had issues with him?”

A pause.</p>

<p>“Some of the other guys...they teased him sometimes. Said some pretty nasty stuff. Orphan jokes, that kind of thing. He never reacted, but I knew it got to him.”</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Ben's jaw tightened.

He stepped away from the counter and approached a small group of workers cleaning glasses and chatting casually. “Which of you worked with Henry?”</p>

<p>A few hands went up. One of them chuckled, “What, the sad kid? He was always in his corner, staring like the world owed him something.”

Ben looked at him, eyes cold.

Another one scoffed, “Maybe he finally found someone to care. Or maybe a trash can. Honestly, guy had a face only a disappearance could fix.”

That was it.

Ben's hand shot forward, slamming the guy against the bar, fingers closing tightly around his throat. The laughter died. Silence fell like a dropped glass. Ben's grip held for a second longer than needed , long enough to make a point, then he let go.

The guy gasped for breath, eyes wide, but said nothing more.</p>

<p>“You think one of them could've done something?” the manager asked, cautiously.</p>

<p>Ben nodded once. “I do.”</p>

<p>“But the night he disappeared, they were all still here. Every one of them. I was on shift. They didn't leave until well after Henry clocked out.”

Ben didn't answer. He just left.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>He returned to his room, stuck more photos around Henry's co-workers, a map of the route home. He traced the line from the bar to Henry's apartment with red string, following it with his finger. One long stretch of empty road. Hardly any lights. Sparse traffic. No cameras. Just shadows, rain, and silence.

He walked that same road himself later that night. Nothing new. No tire marks. No footprints. The rain had washed everything away.

No clues. No evidence. No sound.

Days passed. Then a week.

No movement in the case.

Then came the orders.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In a stiff office lined with silence and filled with men who stopped believing in ghosts, his superior spoke flatly, “We're closing it. Could be a runaway. Maybe the kid couldn't take the mockery anymore. Happens.”

Ben stood there, silent but boiling.</p>

<p>“You don't agree, Carter?” the official asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Ben replied, without hesitation. “I don't.”</p>

<p>“There's nothing to go on.”</p>

<p>“There's something. We're just not seeing it.”</p>

<p>The official sighed. “You've done your job. Case's done. Move on.”

Ben walked out. But he didn't move on.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>That night, he stood in the rain, unmoving, the streets around him quiet and cold. Water ran down his coat. Lightning split the sky in the distance.

From across the street, hidden in the veil of shadows, something or someone watched.

A figure. Silent. Still.

And then a whisper in the dark:</p>
